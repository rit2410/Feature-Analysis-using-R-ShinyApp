In this repo, I have developed an shiny application which shows relationship between Sepal lengths and other variables which are Petal Lengths, Petal Widths, Sepal Widths and Species in the Iris flower dataset. 

It is very simple to use, just select the variables against Sepal Length and it will show the relationship. It also includes regression.The files of the applications are:
* ui.R
* server.R

The application is accesible in: https://rit2410.shinyapps.io/appshiny/
